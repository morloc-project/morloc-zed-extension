# Morloc language support for Zed

This extension adds language support for the Morloc programming language
[morloc-project/morloc](https://github.com/morloc-project/morloc).

The tree-sitter grammar is defined in
[morloc-project/tree-sitter-morloc](https://github.com/morloc-project/tree-sitter-morloc). This
grammar successfully parses all Morloc code from tests in the Morloc test suite
(v0.53.7).
